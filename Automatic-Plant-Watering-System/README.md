# IoT Based Automated Plant Watering System

I did this project when I was undergoing training under Acmegrade Embedded Systems Training programme in december of 2023. This project was a great learning experience to get accustomed to designing, testing and simulating embedded systems.  

The system incorporates sensors to monitor soil moisture levels and autonomously waters plants as needed, minimizing manual intervention. This directory details the hardware components, including sensors, a microcontroller, and a water pump, as well as the software algorithms developed for system control. I have included the circuit diagram, schematic diagram, design flow and the arduino sketch of the project. Additionally, I created a culmination of every aspect of the project in the form of a detailed report(which I have also included here).

### Proposed System

The proposed system uses sensors, motors, and LEDs on a breadboard, interfaced with an Arduino UNO Board. The proposed IoT-based plant watering system consists of moisture sensors placed in the plant's soil to measure moisture levels. These sensors communicate with a central hub or controller that analyses the data and triggers a water pump when the soil moisture falls below a certain threshold. The system can be programmed to water specific plants at designated times, ensuring they receive the right amount of water. Additionally, the system can be controlled remotely via a smartphone app, allowing users to monitor and adjust watering schedules from anywhere. This smart system optimizes plant care, conserves water, and promotes sustainable gardening practices.

IOT Based Automated Plant Watering System :-
1. Install moisture sensors in the soil of each plant to measure moisture levels accurately.
2. Connect the moisture sensors to a central hub or controller that can analyse the data and trigger a water pump when the soil moisture is below the set threshold.
3. Program the system to water specific plants at scheduled times and monitor and adjust watering schedules remotely using a smartphone app for optimal plant care and water conservation.

### Limitations

One limitation of existing IoT-based automated plant watering systems is the potential for technical malfunctions or connectivity issues, which can disrupt the system's ability to accurately monitor and water plants. Another limitation is the reliance on a stable internet connection for remote monitoring and control, which may not always be available in certain environments. Additionally, these systems may require regular maintenance and calibration to ensure accurate sensor readings and proper functioning. Finally, the initial cost of purchasing and setting up an IoT-based system may be a barrier for some users, limiting widespread adoption.

### Future Scope

In urban environments, where space constraints and water scarcity pose significant challenges to traditional farming methods, IoT-enabled plant watering systems provide a scalable and sustainable alternative. By harnessing the power of data analytics, machine learning, and automation, these systems can optimize water usage, reduce waste, and increase crop yields in vertical farms, rooftop gardens, and indoor cultivation facilities. Moreover, their ability to integrate seamlessly with smart city infrastructure enables real-time monitoring and management of green spaces, enhancing urban biodiversity and improving quality of life for residents.

### Conclusion

The IOT based automated plant watering system project represents a significant step forward in the realm of sustainable agriculture, urban farming, and environmental conservation. By leveraging the power of Internet of Things (IOT) technology, this project offers a scalable and efficient solution to the challenges of water management, food production, and ecosystem restoration. Through real-time monitoring, data-driven insights, and automated control mechanisms, the system enables precise and optimal watering schedules tailored to the specific needs of plants, promoting healthier growth, and maximizing resource efficiency.
