# Combinational Lock System 

The Arduino-Based Combinational Lock System is developed to overcome the
issue of carrying a physical key and the break-ins that are possible due to this
reason. This project has the capability to increase the security level of the lock system with an easy and simple approach. 

### Proposed System

An Arduino UNO Board is used in the simulation of a combinational lock system.
A breadboard is used to hold six push buttons and eight LEDs, out of which one is
a green LED (positive output) and the other is a red LED (negative output).
Connecting and jumper wires are used to connect the push buttons to the digital
pins of the Arduino UNO and the LEDs to the analog pins of the Arduino UNO. The system uses the concept of a combination lock. A combination lock is a type of locking device in which a sequence of symbols, usually numbers, is used to open the lock.

Combination locks have been there for decades and many products such as
briefcases and doors are protected by them.

Arduino-Based Combination Lock :-
1. The user enters the combination code using the push buttons
2. The Arduino System identifies the password and tries to match it with the
combination sequence given in the code
3. If they match, the user is allowed to enter

### Tools and Components

1) Simulation Tool
   - TinkerCad

2) Hardware Components
   1) Arduino UNO(R3/R4)
   2) Breadboard
   3) Push Button
   4) LED

### Limitations

An Arduino-based combinational lock system has limitations such as limited security due to predictable algorithms, low processing power restricting complex encryption, vulnerability to physical tampering, and restricted memory for storing codes. Additionally, it's challenging to implement advanced features like multi-factor authentication or remote access, reducing its effectiveness in high-security applications.
