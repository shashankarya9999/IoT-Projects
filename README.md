1) [**Automatic Plant Watering System**](https://github.com/shashankarya9999/IoT-Projects/tree/main/Automatic-Plant-Watering-System)
   - Description: This project leverages soil moisture sensors interfaced with a microcontroller to continuously monitor moisture levels in real-time. When the soil moisture drops below a predefined threshold, the system triggers a relay module to activate a water pump, with all data and control functionalities accessible remotely via an IoT platform, enabling precise and automated irrigation management.
